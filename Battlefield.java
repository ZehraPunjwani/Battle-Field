//There are three soldiers on a Battlefield each from opposing sides. The Battlefield is 0<=X<=100, 0<=Y<=100. Each soldier travels has its own speed. 
//The goal for each soldier is to wound one other soldier. The Winner is, calculated depending on the time it takes for a soldier to get from its position to 
//the opponents position. At the end the winner soldier takes the position of its opponent after wounding it and the opponent disappears from the board 
//or stays in the same position. The program runs three times and in each case the third soldier remains uneffected.
